# data_analysis_gdp_energy_decoupling_europe

This repo contains my first data analysis: An in-depth examination of energy consumption and GDP of European countries.

Focusing on visualization, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (after preparing and roughly describing the data).  
I used data from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat), Europe's official statistics bureau.

## How to View the Dashboards

### Option 1: Run the Notebooks
1. Download the whole project.  
2. Run the notebook **`Main_Notebook_Data_Preparation.ipynb`**.  
3. Then run **`Main_Notebook_EDA.ipynb`**.  
4. To view the dashboards interactively, open the **Dash-URLs**  
   (you can find them in the subfolders of `"dashboards_and_tables"`, inside the run-functions for the different apps).

### Option 2: View the Snapshot Images
- Check the subfolders of `"dashboards_and_tables"` and open the **JPEG files**.  
- These contain visual snapshots of the dashboards.

### Option 3: The Easiest Way
- Simply go to the **"IMPRESSIONS"** folder!  
- This contains an overview of the dashboards in image format.
