# data_analysis_gdp_energy_decoupling_europe
This repo contains my first data analysis: An in depth examination of energy consumption and gdp of european countries. 

Focusing on visualization, I did an exploratory data analysis (after preparing and roughly describing the data). I used data from eurostat.com, Europe's official statistics bureau.

To have a glimpse at the dashboards I developped: 
    Either:
      1. Download the whole project, run the notebook "Main_Notebook_Data_Preparation.ipynb"
      2. Then run the notebook "Main_Notebook_EDA.ipynb"
      To have a (better) look at the dashboard, open the dash-urls (you can find them in the subfolders of "dashboards_and_tables" in the run-functions for the different apps)
    Or:
      check the subfolders of "dashboards_and_tables" and open the jpeg-files! I prepared some visual snapshots of the boards

Have fun looking at the project and contact me anytime, if you have questions!

P.S.: textx and data colums are in German currently.
